## üë®‚Äçüíª About Me
User centric technologist with extensive experience developing/managing internal solutions, managing agile development processes, and managing startup operations/operators. Proven track record in both demanding startup and complex corporate environments. I bring vision and connection for high performance, cross-functional teams. Experienced in working with customers, defining use cases, identifying stakeholders, selecting metrics, gathering/synthesizing data, and running processes to drive execution. Natural systems thinker who loves finding simple solutions to hard problems. Aka a lazy hacker turned professional problem solver.

## üèóÔ∏è Experience
- I have program managed platform teams (storage and user assets) and a front end team (web photo library) for Snapfish (owned by HP at the time), by running agile processes, identifying/mitigating risk, managing dependencies, and coordinating cross-functional teams.  
- I have product manager
