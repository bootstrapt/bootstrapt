## Nick Turner
Currently seeking the next opportunity. I'm a technical PM, self taught coder, and decent analyst. More toward the Generalist or Technologist PM [archtypes](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/product-managers-for-the-digital-world).

I have been mostly on the platform / backend side of the house, but I'm interested in taking a more user facing product role. Whether I was organizing work as a program manager at HP, building out internal platforms as a product manager at eBay, or directly managing operations for a high growth (venture backed) startup at Visor, I always approached what I was building with a product mindset. Identifying problems and friction for internal users, and developing solutions to make it easy as possible for them to be successful.

### About
Startup operator and tech industry professional with extensive experience developing/running/improving internal solutions, managing engineering processes, and managing operations.

Natural systems thinker who loves finding simple solutions to hard problems. Aka a [lazy](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/568877-i-choose-a-lazy-person-to-do-a-hard-job) [hacker](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html#attitude) turned professional [problem solver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP4lrVIpbvo).

### Interview Problems
Showcasing some of my work. I like to think my approach balances the need for rigor with the need for speed. Decisions need to be made thoughfully, but quickly, in order to remain competitive in today's fast paced business environment.

##### Clipboard Health
- Clipboard Health has a [pricing problem](https://creatingvalue.substack.com/p/real-problems-we-tackle-pricing-level) they use to screen candidates. They would like a recommendation for how much they should pay drivers for an Uber like app. In order to solve this problem, I built a model on a spreadsheet to calculate the amount of volume increase needed to offset increases in driver pay. You can see my solution [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xt_NnPP7cAO-R5TThhlmlfa7mdHtxImy8thzjMHSwfU/edit?usp=sharing).
- The next round required a little more research. I used a fairly methodical approach in a Jupyter Notebook. You can see my analysis [here](https://github.com/bootstrapt/clipboard-health-wbd-notebook/blob/main/pricing_wbd.ipynb).


##### SafeGraph
SafeGraph is looking for a Technical Product Manager for their APIs. Rather than simply answer the questions, I went ahead and fired up another Jupyter Notebook and actually implemented API calls using Python and R, using both generic HTTP libraries as well as their official client libraries. You can view that [here](https://bootstrapt.github.io/safegraph-practice-problems/).
