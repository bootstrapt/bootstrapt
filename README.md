## 👨‍💻 About Me
People oriented technologist with extensive experience developing/managing/improving internal solutions, managing engineering processes, and managing startup operations (and operators). Proven track record in both demanding startup and complex corporate environments.

Natural systems thinker who loves finding simple solutions to hard problems. Aka a lazy hacker turned professional problem solver.

## 📚 Portfolio
#### Interview Problems
Since most of my work was proprietary, I am using interview problems to showcase my skills. My approach balances the need for rigor with the need for speed.
