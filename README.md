## 🏗️ Experience
_See my [resume](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17Oe8Tab9zK4oKPVTXrHdub56eSGYvIIJHS_jAFRehu8/edit?usp=sharing) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickolasturner/) for more details._
My journey into software development has been an exciting blend of hands-on experience, continual learning, and strategic decision-making, shaped by both successes and challenges.

From an early age, I was fascinated by how technology could solve complex problems. This passion led me to pursue a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration with a concentration in Entrepreneurship & Small Business Management from SFSU. My career began at the intersection of business and technology, where I quickly learned the importance of agile development and team leadership.

### Early Career and Growth
Starting at Plug and Play Tech Center, I secured the job by assertively following up with the CEO and spending almost a full buisness day waiting for a meeting. This persistence marked the beginning of my professional journey, where I managed events and implemented marketing tools that significantly increased our social media following and lead generation. This role solidified my understanding of the business impacts of technical decisions.

As I moved to roles at Rover and Snapfish (a division of Hewlett Packard), I took on more responsibility. At Snapfish, I started as Scrum Master for one team and ended up as Platform Engineering Program Manager for the web photo library, user assets API, and storage API, managing teams in the US and India. We launched Snapfish 2.0, transitioning from a monolithic to a service-oriented architecture. This project enabled the launch of a mobile app and involved live migrating ~20PB of data using both a background job and real-time migration. These experiences underscored the importance of detailed planning and the ability to adapt to evolving technical landscapes.

### Leadership and Innovation
At eBay, I had the opportunity to drive innovation by developing a platform to match employee prototypes with management sponsors. This project increased engagement and participation in innovation programs, showcasing my ability to leverage technology to foster creativity and collaboration. My time at eBay also included launching the first innovation studio space, which became a hub for experimenting with cutting-edge technologies.

At Visor (now Grid), a fintech app, I managed the Atlanta office, blending leadership and technological know-how. I identified key performance metrics, built reporting around them, and managed day-to-day operations. To complement our main app, which had the full focus of our engineering talent, I developed an internal app that enhanced our operational capabilities. This role highlighted my ability to drive operational efficiency and develop technological solutions to support business growth.

### Fintech and Beyond
Leading engineering at Neon Money Club, I launched backend services for a fintech stock investing app, managing a remote engineering team and ensuring continuous delivery through a robust CI/CD pipeline. This role highlighted my ability to balance technical architecture considerations with business needs, delivering scalable and secure solutions.

### Looking Ahead
As I continue to navigate the ever-evolving landscape of technology, I remain committed to leveraging my diverse experiences to drive innovation and deliver value. Whether leading a team, architecting complex systems, or exploring new technologies, my goal is to create solutions that are not only effective but also transformative.
