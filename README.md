## Latest News
Currently seeking the next opportunity. I'm a technical PM who can understand and empathize with users of all levels, wrangle data to compare qualitative insight with quantitative analyses, and build those insights into solutions that delight users.

I have been mostly on the platform / backend side of the house, but I'm interested in taking a more user facing product role. Whether I was organizing work as a program manager at HP, building out internal platforms as a product manager at eBay, or directly managing operations for a high growth, venture backed startup at Visor, I always approached what I was building with a product mindset. Identifying friction for internal users using qualitative and quantitive approaches, developing solutions, tracking metrics, fixing bugs, and continuously shipping incremental features.

## About Me
Startup operator and tech industry professional with extensive experience developing/running/improving internal solutions, managing engineering processes, and managing operations.

Natural systems thinker who loves finding simple solutions to hard problems. Aka a [lazy](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/568877-i-choose-a-lazy-person-to-do-a-hard-job) [hacker](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html#attitude) turned professional [problem solver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP4lrVIpbvo).

## Portfolio

#### Interview Problems
Since most of my work was proprietary, I am using interview problems to showcase my skills. My approach balances the need for rigor with the need for speed. Decisions need to be made thoughtfully, but quickly, in order to remain competitive in today's fast paced business environment.
