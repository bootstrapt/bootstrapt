##### Operations
Startup operator at venture backed, high growth startup. Designed, documented, and implemented processes and tools while running the Atlanta office. Managed three dozen tax professionals and account managers. Implemented new processes to match our new apps. Our stack was a Go backend, native mobile apps, and a React webapp/admin portal communicating with gRPC built on Google Cloud Platform. Internal processes not supported by the app were tracked in Google Sheets or an AppSheets. I identified throughput metrics and built reports using BigQuery, Data Studio, Sheets, and AppScript. We increased productivity by 3x measured by overall throughput over headcount with our innovative apps, innovative operations, and old fashioned teamwork.
##### Product
Product manager for eBay's internal innovation platform. Identified stakeholders, defined use cases, and worked with design/engineering to launch a new innovation marketplace bringing together employee driven prototypes with management sponsorship. Portal built with Angular/Typescript, MongoDB, Kubernetes/Docker, and Openstack. Launched eBay's first innovation studio with access to VR, 3d printer, various SOCs, and other hardware. Managed JIRA and portal for open source working group. The marketplace generated a 36% increase in ideas submitted, a 54% increase in the number of participants company-wide, and a 6x increase in the number of projects sponsored by upper management.
##### Program
Program manager for Snapfish platform teams. Ran agile processes, identified/mitigated risk, managed dependencies, and coordinated cross-functional teams (product, engineering, and design). We deployed next generation services to enable a better user experience and mobile apps. Platform teams included Storage (Openstack Swift), User Assets API (MongoDB/Java), and web Photo Library (Ruby/Rails). After launch and a family emergency, I took an IC role administering JIRA, Splunk, and other internal tools. Iteratively developed Python CLI tools leveraging internal APIs.
