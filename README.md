Currently seeking the next opportunity.

I have been effective in both demanding startup enviroments and complex corporate environments.

Natural systems thinker who loves finding simple solutions to hard problems. Aka a [lazy](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/568877-i-choose-a-lazy-person-to-do-a-hard-job) [hacker](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html#attitude) turned professional [problem solver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP4lrVIpbvo).

## üìö Technical Portfolio
#### Interview Problems
Since most of my work was proprietary, I am using interview problems to showcase my skills. My approach balances the need for rigor with the need for speed. Decisions need to be made thoughtfully, but quickly, in order to remain competitive in today's fast paced business environment.
